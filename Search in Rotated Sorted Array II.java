// Follow up for "Search in Rotated Sorted Array":
// What if duplicates are allowed?
// Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
// Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
// (i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).
// Write a function to determine if a given target is in the array.
// The array may contain duplicates.

public class Solution {
    public boolean search(int[] nums, int target) {
        int start = 0, end = nums.length - 1, mid = -1;
        while(start <= end) {
            mid = (start + end) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return true;
            }
            //If we know for sure right side is sorted or left side is unsorted
            if (nums[mid] < nums[end] || nums[mid] < nums[start]) {
                if (target > nums[mid] && target <= nums[end]) {
                    start = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    end = mid - 1;
                }
            //If we know for sure left side is sorted or right side is unsorted
            } else if (nums[mid] > nums[start] || nums[mid] > nums[end]) {
                if (target < nums[mid] && target >= nums[start]) {
                    end = mid - 1;
                } else {
                    start = mid + 1;
                }
            //If we get here, that means nums[start] == nums[mid] == nums[end], then shifting out
            //any of the two sides won't change the result but can help remove duplicate from
            //consideration, here we just use end-- but left++ works too
            } else {
                end--;
            }
        }       
        return false;
    }
}

// Since we will have some duplicate elements in this problem,
// it is a little tricky because sometimes we cannot decide whether to go to the left side or right side.
// So for this condition, I have to probe both left and right side simultaneously to decide which side we need to
// find the number. Only in this condition, the time complexity may be O(n). The rest conditions are always O(log n).
